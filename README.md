## Website

A multi-page website of an online store of office equipment was made.

## Description

During the information systems design course, I developed the terms of reference and designed the logic of the online store in `Erwin Data Modeler` and `StarUML`. 
As a basis I took the layout that I made. 
I also realized the possibility of registration using Firebase, where data about users are stored.
In the process of performing any actions by the user, he receives notifications (for example, notification of successful authorization)

## Tools

This site was designed to consolidate knowledge in learning `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `React`.
